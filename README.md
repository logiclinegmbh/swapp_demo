# swapp
Swapp is a template that provides a basic functionality and dynamic integration with Postgress database which has been provided as an Add-on on Heroku. It is an example for a simple web application that can be used as a starting point to create your own Heroku app.

Our deployment package uses standard enterprise technologies like Java, Spring, Hibernate and connects these with a state of the art cloud based managed platform. Using mvc architecture makes it easy for you to be able to extend the code to serve your own purposes. This architectural pattern can be used to demonstrate the strenght of Heroku working together with established enterprise technologies. 

By using the "Deploy to Heroku" button there is no need to configure your code. In a few seconds you have a ready-to-use code on the Heroku platform and can deploy your own version of Swapp on Heroku.
